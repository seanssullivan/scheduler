# Interview Scheduler
A React-based scheduling app to create, edit and delete interview appointments. The app uses Axios to send and receive requests to an API server running on Express, and receives real-time updates using WebSockets.

React components were developed using Storybook. Uses Jest and Cypress for testing.

Built as part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.
